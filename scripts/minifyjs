# minifyjs
# Author: Mario Fernandez
#
# Minifies all the javascript files present in the current directory,
# using the closure compiler from google. By convention the output is
# named as fileName.min.js.
#
# Usage: minifyjs
#
# Requirements:
#
# Java is required, the closure compiler must be installed and
# available under the CLOSURE_COMPILER env variable
