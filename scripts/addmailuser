# Adds a user to a linux system that is prepared to receive
# mail. Requires being run with sudo.
#
# NOTE: this script receives the password in plain text as argument,
# and as such it is NOT safe. DO NOT use it if someone else has access
# to the list of processes, or if the users should be secure.

# Make mail directories
