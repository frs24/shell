# git-sync-github-fork
# Author: Mario Fernandez
#
# Synchronizes the given github fork with the original.
#
# The following assumptions are made:
#
# - The original repo is available as a remote under the 'remote'
# variable.
# - The master branch can be fast-forwarded with the content of the
# main branch of the source.
# - There is a branch where changes are integrated, under the 'devel'
# variable.
#
# The master branch is synchronized with the latest changes in the
# source repo. This changes are merged to the development branch, and
# both branches are pushed to origin.
#
# By using this setup, the master is always compatible with the source
# repository, and thus any feature branch created from master can be
# used for a clean pull request, without unnecessary merge commits.
