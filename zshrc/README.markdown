# Z-shell config

This is a configuration for the z-shell.

## Setting zsh as the default shell

Run:

`chsh -s /bin/zsh`

## Oh-my-zsh

This configuration requires the __Oh-my-zsh__. Clone it from:

* `git clone https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git` for the
* original
* `git clone git@github.com:sirech/shell.git` for my modified version

Then set the _ZSH_ enviroment variable in the _zsh_ file to the folder
where you cloned the project.
